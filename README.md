# QuickRef
This code consists of a number of different examples of Python functions and techniques. I'm trying to create a different kind of "quick reference" to the language that demonstrates the code in context and actually runs, because I find that most quick references are too sterile to drop into real coding situations.

I try to include unit tests when possible. A lot of the examples of techniques and features are actually in the test themselves. (Use **pytest**!) I have also tried to comment on some of the less obvious content.

### Disclaimer
Most of the examples themselves are utterly useless. There is little or no organization. The "whiteboard.py" file is just a scratch file for ideas I'm noodling with, rather than branching and all that. I was trying to keep this Python2.7 compliant, but I've decided to SLOWLY bring it up to 3.x as I get time.

This code is strictly for my own benefit; you may steal it, clone it, fork it, or throw me a pull request if you like.
